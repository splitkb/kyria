## High Profile Case

The high profile case covers both the top, bottom and the sides. When cut from frosted acrylic, this provides a nicely diffused effect inc combination with underglow.

## Plate Case

The plate case is an option which covers just the PCB and nothing more. Great if you desire a lower weight or a lower price.
